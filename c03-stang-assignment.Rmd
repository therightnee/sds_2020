*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes, the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this challenge you'll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a number of Aluminum plates to determine their [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio). These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such as aircraft skin under [buckling loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking)) direction.

# Loading and Wrangle
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data for this challenge.

```{r load}
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
df_stang
```

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

__q1__ Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, mu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special value for `names_to`.

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
    pivot_longer(
      names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
      names_sep = "_",
      cols = c(-thick, -alloy),
    ) %>%
    mutate(angle = as.integer(angle)) %>%
    filter(E >= 0)
  
df_stang_long
```

Use the following tests to check your work.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
              setequal(
                df_stang_long %>% names,
                c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "mu")
              )
            )
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
            )

print("Very good!")
```

# EDA
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks
<!-- ------------------------- -->

__q2__ Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own question that you'd like to answer about the data.

```{r q2-task}
##
df_stang_long %>% 
  group_by(angle) %>%
  summarize(E = mean(E), mu = mean(mu))

```

**Observations**:

The officially listed Modulus of Elasticity (taken from a number of sources, most notably the MIL-HDBK-5H, dated December 1st, 1998) for Aluminum 2024-T3 is 10.5 ksi, which is significantly higher than the empirically determined 10.3 ksi. Additionally, the Poisson ratio is lower than the listed 0.33.

It is also interesting to note that the highest modulous and poisson ratio is at the 45 degree angle.

## Visualize
<!-- ------------------------- -->

__q3__ Create a visualization to investigate your question from q1 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group=angle, x=angle, y=E, color=thick)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=10500, linetype="dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Modulus of Elasticity Relative to Test Angle",
       y="Modulus of Elasticity (ksi)",
       x="Test Angle (degrees)")

df_stang_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group=angle, x=angle, y=mu, color=thick)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0.33, linetype="dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Poisson Ratio Relative to Test Angle",
       y="Poisson Ratio",
       x="Test Angle (degrees)")

df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(mu, E, shape = as_factor(thick), color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  stat_ellipse() +
  labs(title = "Grouping as a Function of Sample Source",
       y="Modulous of Elasticity (ksi)",
       x="Poisson Ratio") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=10500, linetype="dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0.33, linetype="dashed", color = "blue")

```

**Observations**:

The "target" modulus and poisson ratio are basically outside the upper quartile of all measurements
They barely fall within the extremes regarding the poisson ratio
There are several conclusions I would take away from this:
1. I would reevaluate my benchmark alloy of 2024-T3, it is likely not a proper 1:1 comparison
2. we expect the manufacturing variability to fall on a normal distribution, something the box plot helps to illustrate
if we take the position that both of these are intensive values we can use this data to help inform what the Poisson ratio and Young's Modulus should be for this material, as was the intention for the group conducting this study
graphs 1 and 2 indicate a negative skew in the data for all tests except for the Modulus in the 0 degree case, where it is closer to a normal distribution
this is in line with the understanding that the "target" value is much higher than what we have seen in the data and that this negative skew is dragging down the mean
3. Finally, a reiteration of a point I made previously, the source of the sample does correlate with the measured values.

__q4__ Consider the following statement:

"A material's property (or material property) is an intensive property of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material."[2]

Note that the "amount of material" would vary with the thickness of a tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim that "elasticity `E` is an intensive material property." Why or why not? Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

```{r q4-vis}
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Observations**:

On it's face it seems that it is a contrarian graph, but look to the previous response under Q3 for a deeper look at why this may, in fact, prove the above statement.
