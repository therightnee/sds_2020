*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these different variables. Unless we're careful and thorough, we can easily miss these patterns. In this challenge you'll analyze a dataset with a small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about 67% of its passengers died.

# First Look
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

__q1__ Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

**Observations**:

- List the variables here
class (4 options) /sex (binary - male/female/age(binary - child/adult)/survived(binary - yes/no)

__q2__ Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of passengers. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

```{r q2-summary}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

Passengers: 1,316 Crew: 908 Total:2,224
Total from dataset - 2201

Dataset is short 23, which is pretty good given the age of the ship's manifest. It is not clear what is missing from the dataset, though my teammate Ingrid made an interseting note that the Captain is not counted among the crew, as he is the "owner" of the ship.

__q3__ Create a plot showing the count of passengers who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`

# create a dataset
 survivors <-
  df_titanic %>%
  filter(
    Survived == "Yes"
  )
 
# Grouped
survivors %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex), position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Stacked Representation of Survivorship Based on Gender and Class")

 child_survivors <-
  df_titanic %>%
  filter(
    Survived == "Yes",
    Age == "Child"
  )

# Grouped
child_survivors %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex), position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Stacked Representation of Survivorship Based on Gender and Class for Children")


```

The mentality of "women and children" first definitely seems to apply here, as evidenced by the high proportion of female survivors.

# Deeper Look
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for understanding differences between groups. This is because the differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.[1]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age` group.

```{r compute-prop}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

__q4__ Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3.

```{r q4-task}

# create a dataset
 prop_survivors <-
  df_prop %>%
  filter(
    Survived == "Yes"
  )
 
# Class
prop_survivors %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Age), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Proportional Representation of Survivorship Based on Class")


```

**Observations**:

The stark drop in survivorship in 3rd class, for both children and adults, has reinforced in me the desire to never fly economy again. In our team discussions we did note that low surivorship for children in 3rd class may have been influenced by the time of the accident, the ship began sinking at 2 AM, and the labyrinthine route needed to reach the surface from the lower tiers.

__q5__ Create a plot showing the group-proportion of passengers who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don't forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider additional variables!

```{r q5-task}

ggplot() + 
  geom_col(data = prop_survivors, aes(Class, Prop))+
  labs(title = "Survivors by Proportion",
       y="Proportional",
       x="Class")+
  facet_grid(Sex ~ Age)

```

**Observations**:

I really enjoyed using facet grid to increase the informational density of the graph. I started by plotting the raw counts vs. the proportional survivorship results, but kept only the proportional graph because looking at just raw counts less edifying With the proportional results we can quickly see that all children were saved regardless of gender, in both the first and second classes. Sadly, the third class children fared far worse, with a bias towards females.

# Notes
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

[1] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
